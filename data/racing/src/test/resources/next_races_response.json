Didn't let supporters down at his latest appearance when he got the job done by 2 metres over 1609m at this track. Meets a comparable field and he can get the job done again. BAYFIELD BEACH (1) finished runner-up at his most recent outing, beaten one metre, in a nice return to form at this track over 1609m. Sure to enjoy an economical run from this draw. Won't find this any harder and he can go one better without surprising. BATTERUP HANOVER (3) is flying at present with two successive wins to his name, most recently at Flamboro Downs a week-and-a-half ago. Big chance to keep the ball rolling. BETTER SUNSET (2) is close to a win after two successive placings, the latest a second over 1609m at this track.",
